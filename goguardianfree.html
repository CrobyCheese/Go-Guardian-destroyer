<strong>THIS is a Go Guardian proof page!</strong>
<p>This was simply made for fun and if you use it and get in trouble not my issue, its just fun to make stuff like this. Go in the code and change the website in the iframe tag and don't touch anything else! Any time you want access to this site in a go guardian session just open up this html file. </p>
<!-- in src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1171710255/embed"  put the website you want to be go guardian proof in replacement of the scratch game-->
